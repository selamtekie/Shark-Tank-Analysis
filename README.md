# Shark-Tank-Analysis
## Executive Summary

Shark Tank is a reality business-themed show on ABC where entrepreneurs come to pitch their business idea with the goal of getting the sharks to invest in their businesses. The end goal for the entrepreneurs that come to the show is to win over the sharks with their business pitch and convince them to invest in their businesses.

# Motivation

In recent years the Shark Tank, the nationally acclaimed series has become my family’s favorite. During the introduction part every episode, the viewers and the sharks learn about the businesses/entrepreneurs successes or impediments and why they need the sharks partnership/investments

# Data Question

Based on previous episodes I wanted to do an exploratory data analysis and look at the dynamic of industries that got funded and if there was any pattern in the investments the sharks made.
